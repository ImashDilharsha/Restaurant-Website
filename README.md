# The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic, database-driven web application for The Gallery Café, a renowned restaurant located in Colombo. This project aims to leverage technological advancements to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and improve overall business efficiency.
# 
# The web application’s goal is to offer a seamless platform for customers to explore the restaurant's menu, make table reservations, and pre-order meals. It will feature functionalities such as displaying menus, showcasing special events and promotions, and providing information on table capacities and parking availability.
# 
# With a user registration system, the application will support three roles: Admins, who manage content and user logins; operational staff, who handle reservations and pre-orders; and customers, who will enjoy an intuitive interface for browsing menus and placing orders.
